## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Company vs. Private Person

Fakturowo requires the following when issuing invoices:
Company invoices (for Polish buyers) must include a valid NIP (tax ID).
If no NIP is provided, the invoice is treated as a private individual.
In that case:
The Company field is ignored.
First name and last name must be provided.
Make sure your CSV is filled accordingly based on buyer type.
